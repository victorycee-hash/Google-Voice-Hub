# Google Voice Hub

**Overview**  
Google Voice Hub is a digital communication system designed to organize and simplify how people manage phone calls, messages, and voicemails. The idea behind it is to help individuals and teams reduce communication clutter by gathering all voice-related activities in one place. It gives users an organized way to view, respond to, and act on their calls and messages without switching between different apps or devices.

**What the Product Does**  
Google Voice Hub serves as a unified communication hub that connects phone calls, text messages, and voicemails under one platform. Instead of juggling several numbers or apps, users can handle all interactions from a single dashboard. The system automatically transcribes voicemails, recognizes possible next actions, and connects with other Google tools like Calendar, Tasks, and Gmail to make follow-up actions seamless.

**Why It Matters**  
Many people lose track of important calls or messages because their communication channels are scattered. Freelancers, small business owners, and remote workers often deal with missed calls, unsaved voicemails, and delayed responses. Google Voice Hub addresses this problem by turning every voice message or call into organized information that can be acted on immediately. This approach reduces stress, saves time, and improves productivity by keeping all conversations visible and actionable.

**Who It Is For**  
Google Voice Hub is for people and small teams who want better control over their communication flow.  
It can be used by:  
- Freelancers or business owners who manage client calls and follow-ups  
- Professionals who need a structured way to handle multiple calls and messages  
- Teams that share one business number and need a coordinated system for responding  

**Key Features**  
- A single dashboard that displays all calls, texts, and voicemails  
- Automatic transcription of voicemails into readable text  
- AI-powered detection of message intent (for example, identifying requests to schedule a meeting or send a file)  
- Integration with Google Calendar, Gmail, and Tasks for automatic action suggestions  
- Smart call routing that allows teams to share one line and manage calls by availability

**Technologies Used**  
- Frontend: React.js for building the user interface
